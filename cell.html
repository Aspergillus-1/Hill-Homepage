<P>
<i>Cell Biology</i> explores the fundamental workings of the eukaryotic cell, placing 
its principal emphases upon the structure and function of biological membranes, 
the cytoskeleton, the pathways of signal transduction, and the organelles of the 
endomembrane system.  Students who are also interested in details of gene 
regulation and the pathways of metabolism will find that BIOL-325 (<i>Molecular Biology</i>) 
and CHEM-414 (<i>Biochemistry</i>) complement the topics in this course with little duplication.  
Optional laboratory credit is provided by <i>Methods in Biochemistry and Cell Biology</i> 
(BCMB-310), which also confers laboratory credit to accompany Biochemistry.
<P>
The goal of this course is for you to learn more than merely facts (though 
indeed there will be many facts to learn), but more importantly to <u>develop 
skills of "cell biological reasoning.</u>"  To that end, frequent emphasis will be 
placed in lecture upon the experimental approach to understanding the workings 
of cells; and examinations and quizzes will contain numerous questions that 
expect you to draw conclusions from experimental data or to predict the outcomes 
of experimental manipulations.
<P>
Rather than aiming for superficial breadth of coverage, BIOL-307 focuses instead 
upon a smaller set of topics, treating each in enough detail to let you to build 
a sound, integrated understanding of the structural and regulatory complexity of 
life at the level of the cell.  We will begin this course where your introductory 
study of cells and molecules left off - we won't spend time repeating what you 
should have learned in Core.  Appropriate to the intended level of the course, 
the text is one of the standards used in cell biology courses at the graduate 
level.  Expect to be challenged.
