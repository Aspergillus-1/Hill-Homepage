<H3>Drs. Hill and Loprete are recipients of a $560,000 grant from the National 
Science Foundation, 
in support of their collaborative research in fungal genetics.  
Funding began January 1, 2003, and is expected to continue through December 31, 2006.  
Included in the award are funds to support summer research fellowships for 
undergraduate students.  Students with research interests in cell biology, 
microbiology, genetics, and molecular biology are encouraged to apply for 
positions.  Applications will be accepted at any time.</h4>

<p>
The goal of this project is to characterize a new collection of mutations in 
the model research organism <I>Aspergillus nidulans</I>.  These gene defects 
(termed <I>cal</I> mutations) cause loss of cell wall integrity, which is 
detected by exposing the organisms to the wall-compromising agent Calcofluor W
hite and looking for reduced growth.  For more information of the organism, 
the mutations, and the methods employed in the research, interested students 
are directed to the following website:

These fellowships are open to rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are 
majoring in biology, chemistry, or Biochem & Molecular Biology (BMB).  
Students whose career goals include scientific 
research in this area (encompassing genetics, microbiology, cell biology, 
biochemistry, and molecular biology) are especially encouraged to apply.  
While previous coursework (with lab) in these areas is very helpful in an 
application, exceptions can be considered for students who show strong promise in other ways.
