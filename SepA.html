The formin SepA and the protein kinase PkcA play essential roles in both apical growth and cytokinesis in  <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>.  &nbsp;  Deletion of either gene is lethal.
&nbsp;   We have demonstrated that both proteins colocalize at sites of septation (cytokinesis) and at the hyphal apex, though a sub-population of the apical SepA population is localized
 separately in a structure called the Spitzenk&#246;rper (Spk), in which PkcA has not been observed. &nbsp;   We also demonstrate a functional relationship between the two protein, in that elevated
 expression of SepA compensates for deficiency in the function of PkcA.
 
 <p>
 The image below on the left demonstrates colocalization of SepA and PkcA at sites of septation (left-hand panels) and the growning hyphal apex (right-hand panels). &nbsp;   The image on 
  the right below
  shows the inability of a PkcA-mutant strain (R78) to grow in the presence of the wall-inhibitory chemical Calcofluor White (CFW), while the wild type strain (A28) and a strain containing the PkcA 
  plus over-expression of SepA (R1882) can tolerate the inhibitory chemical. &nbsp;   (The left-hand panel in the image shows all three strains growing in the absence of CFW, and the
  right-hand panel in the image shows growth in the presence of CFW.)

 <p>To investigate whether the colocalizing proteins are actually physically binding to 
 each other, we have employed the Yeast-Two-Hybrid procedure along with protein truncation (selective removal of protein domains).  &nbsp; In the image below, the upper diagram depicts the various domains of SepA. &nbsp;  Below that are shown four different truncation constructs 
  that were paired with full-length PkcA in the Y2H procedure. &nbsp;  Protein-protein interaction between PkcA and SepA is shown by the ability of yeast colonies to grow in the
 absence of the amino acid histidine, a property shown only by the two constructs having intact FH2 domains.

The gene has been cloned and shown to be an orthologue of COG4, a component of the Golgi apparatus 
COG (Conserved Oligomeric Golgi) vesicle tethering complex.&nbsp;  The <i>swoP</i>1 mutant allele is predicted to
lack the last 55 amino acids at the C terminal.  &nbsp; Under the direction of Sara Gremillion (Armstrong State University) and in collaboration with
Steve Harris (University of Nebraska), we have characterized the phenotype 
of the <i>swoP</i>1 mutant along with that of the related <i>podB</i>1 mutant in COG2.  (Gremillion et al., 2014)
<P>
By overexpressing known <i>A. nidulans</i> COG orthologues in <i>swoP</i>1 (COG4-defective) or <i>podB</i>1 (COG2-defective) mutant backgrounds, 
Sara has shown genetic interactions between COG4 and COG2 (over-expression of either
can complement the other's phenotype) and between COG3 and COG2.&nbsp;  Over-expression of COG3 
complements the <i>podB</i>1 (COG2-defective) phenotype, but not that of <i>swoP</i>1.&nbsp;  Overexpression of the 
remaining COG orthologues (COG1, COG6, and COG6) is without effect on either mutation.&nbsp;  These results are 
consistent with proposed structures of the "A-lobes" of yeast and mammalian COGs.

GFP chimeras of COG2 and COG4 demonstrate localization of each protein to 
subcellular compartments consistent with the fungal Golgi apparatus (see below).
