The formin SepA and the protein kinase PkcA play essential roles in both apical growth and cytokinesis in  <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i>.  &nbsp;  Deletion of either gene is lethal.
&nbsp;   We have demonstrated that the two proteins colocalize at sites of septation (cytokinesis) and at the hyphal apex, though a sub-population of the apical SepA population is localized
 separately in a structure called the Spitzenk&#246;rper (Spk), in which PkcA has not been observed. &nbsp;   We also demonstrate a functional relationship between the two protein, in that elevated
 expression of SepA compensates for deficiency in the function of PkcA.

 The image below demonstrates colocalization of SepA (green) and PkcA (red) at sites of septation (left-hand panels) and the growing hyphal apex (right-hand panels).

  The image below
  shows the inability of a strain bearing a PkcA-mutation (R78) to grow in the presence of the wall-inhibitory chemical Calcofluor White (CFW), while the wild type strain (A28) and a 
 strain containing the PkcA mutation
  plus over-expression of SepA (R1882) can tolerate the inhibitory chemical. &nbsp;   (The left-hand panel shows all three strains growing in the absence of CFW, and the
  right-hand panels show growth in the presence of CFW.)

 <p>To investigate whether the colocalizing proteins are actually physically binding to 
 each other, we have employed the Yeast-Two-Hybrid procedure along with protein truncation (selective removal of protein domains).  &nbsp; In the image below, the upper diagram depicts the various domains of SepA. &nbsp;  Below that are shown four different truncation constructs 
  that were paired with full-length PkcA in the Y2H procedure. &nbsp;  Protein-protein interaction between PkcA and SepA is shown by the ability of yeast colonies to grow in the
 absence of the amino acid histidine, a property shown only by the two constructs having intact FH2 domains.
