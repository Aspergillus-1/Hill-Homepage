<H3>Calcofluor White (CFW) is a chitin binding agent, which interferes with assembly of 
chitin microfibrils, one of the principal structural components of a fungal cell wall.&nbsp;
Genetically normal (wild type) cells can tolerate a significant amount of CFW in their
environment, but those whose walls are already weakened by genetically determined structural
defects, show severely reduced tolerance of CFW.

<P>
We have identified several CFW hypersensitive strains 
(designated <I>cal</I> mutants), in which the phenotype is governed by 
a single recessive allele.&nbsp;  The alleles have been ordered into nine
complementation groups, representing separate gene loci.

In addition to CFW hypersensitivity, many <I>cal</I> mutant strains also exhibit a number 
of structural aberrations even in the absence of CFW, including altered branching 
patterns, sensitivities to elevated growth 
temperature (see below), and reduced sporulation; all also display sensitivities to
further wall-compromising agents such as Echinocandins (inhibitors of glucan synthesis)
and Nikkomycin (inhibitor of chitin synthesis).

Using molecular techniques, we have identified the mutated genes responsible for the phenotypes of 
six of the <I>cal</I> mutant strains, discovering in the process some genes not yet recognized 
in filamentous fungi, as well as some whose role in cell wall metabolism had not been formerly recognized.&nbsp;
Among these are Protein Kinase C (PkcA) <a href="PKC.html"> (link)</a> and two separate 
GDP-mannose transporters (GMTs) <a href="GMT.html">(link)</a>.
