<P>
This course examines fundamental aspects of life at the level of cells and 
molecules.  Major themes addressed in the course include 1) the nature of 
biologically important molecules and how that relates to the structural 
organization of cells; 2) the cellular mechanisms of heredity and reproduction; 
3) mechanisms by which cell functions are regulated; and 4) the central pathways 
of metabolic energy conversions.  Throughout the course, strong emphasis will 
be placed upon the relationship between complexity of function and complexity 
of structure, as well as upon the importance of energy in any process having complex outcomes.
<p>
Although many topics listed in this syllabus, and even perhaps the textbook that 
we use, may seem familiar to you from your high school courses, you are expected 
to move meaningfully beyond your high school understanding of these topics.  In 
most cases, we will begin each topic more or less where a good high school course 
should have left off.  To the extent that overlap and repetition may be helpful, 
you should expect quite often to find those things assigned to you as independent reading.
<p>
Co-enrollment in Introductory Biology Laboratory (BIO-131) is required for participation
in BIO-130.
