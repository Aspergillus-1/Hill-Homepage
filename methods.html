<B>Course Purpose and Goals</B>
<P>
To a large extent, the study of the cell and its biochemical functions can be 
seen as the study of <U>proteins</u>.  Every regulated function of a cell requires the 
presence of at least one protein in a role such as catalyst, processor of 
information, or component of a complex structure.  A scientist studying a cell 
that contains thousands of different types of proteins must have tools to answer 
a wide range of protein-related questions.  For example . . .
<P>
<I>How much protein does a particular sample contain?  How can I identify which 
of the several proteins in a complex mixture is the one I'm looking for?  How 
can I separate my protein of interest from all the others that are present?  
What are the basic physical properties of my protein?  If my protein is an 
enzyme, how can I quantify the function it performs?  How can I find the most 
likely identification and the most probable functions of a protein about which 
I may know only its amino acid sequence?</i>
<P>
One goal of this course is to give you both practical experience and a 
theoretical background in some of the important current research methods needed 
to answer fundamental questions like these - and, additionally, to give you 
experience working with two important types of proteins, which are essential 
to many investigations in BMB:    <I><U>enzymes</I></U> and <I><U>antibodies</I></U>.
<P>
A further and equally important goal of the course is for you to improve your 
ability to reason your way through experimental situations in general.  
Accordingly, a great deal of emphasis will be placed in the course upon 
your ability to plan research procedures, to carry them out correctly and 
efficiently, and to extract accurate and useful information from the results.  
These skills are <U>amongst the most valuable</U> that you can acquire because they 
can be exported to situations well beyond your experiences in just this course.

<B>Scheduling and Credit</B>
<P>
BMB 310 is a required upper-level course for students majoring in Biochemistry
and Molecular Biology (BMB).  The course meets for four hours a week:  one hour 
of lecture and 3 hours of lab.  Four hours of academic credit are earned. 
Students who are not majoring in BMB can use credit in BMB-310 to fulfill laboratory
credit to accompany both <I>Biochemistry</I> (CHEM-414) and <I>Cell 
Biology</I> (BIOL-307).

 <P>
The lecture component of BMB 310 deals with "practical bioinformatics" - meaning, 
roughly, the use of basic online tools for the identification and predictive 
analysis of proteins, based on knowledge of amino acid sequence.  The 
laboratory component of the course deals with the theory and practice of 
several important "bench" techniques for protein isolation and analysis.  
Laboratory work is open-ended - in several cases the formal lab time serves 
mainly for demonstration of or beginning of a procedure, with 
completion of the work to be done independently on your own schedule.
