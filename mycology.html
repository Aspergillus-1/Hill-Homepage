<H3>COURSE DESCRIPTION</H3></center><p>

Mycology is the study of the fungi, which constitute one of the three major 
kingdoms of eukaryotic organisms (plants and animals being the other two).&nbsp;  
These simple but important microorganisms are essential components of the 
economy of nature, and they also play significant roles in human affairs through 
their actions as agents of disease and decay, as well as through their activities 
n commercial processes like brewing, antibiotic production, and more.

<P>
The course is intended for a broad undergraduate audience, which includes (but 
is not limited to) second and first-year students who may be taking their first 
upper-level laboratory course in biology.&nbsp;  It is therefore taken into account 
that some class members may have little experience in cell-level or chemical-level 
study, and accordingly those aspects of fungal biology that are mainly physiological, 
biochemical, or cell-biological will be less heavily emphasized than will be others.&nbsp;  
Nevertheless, the course will cover all aspects of fungal biology with appropriate breadth and rigor.

<B><h3><CENTER>GRADING</CENTER></h3></B>
Sixty percent of your course grade is determined by your performance on 
four lecture examinations.&nbsp;  There is no cumulative lecture final.&nbsp;  The remaining 
40% of your grade is determined by your performance in Laboratory.&nbsp;  Graded work in Laboratory
includes weekly quizzes, laboratory reports, and a cumulative practical examination.

<center><h3>LABORATORY POLICY and TOPICS</h3></center>
<p>
<p>
The dividing line between learning and scholarship is an active engagement with 
the material.&nbsp;  Accordingly, the goal of the Laboratory section in Mycology is to 
help you develop the skills of observation, identification, and manipulation that 
are essential to doing research with fungi and other microorganisms, and to working 
with them in practical applications.&nbsp;  In this laboratory you will have an opportunity 
to learn, among other things, methods for isolating and identifying fungi from nature, 
basic methods for observing and manipulating fungal growth, and basic methods of 
genetic analysis.&nbsp;  You will also gain experience in using fungi in production of 
commercial products, specifically foods and alcoholic beverages.
